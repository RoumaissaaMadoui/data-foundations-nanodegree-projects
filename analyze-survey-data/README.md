# Interpret a Data Visualization
This project is about analyzing a real dataset about Udacity students across a number of programs. It is a little messy (some things are input incorrectly, others are missing).
## Project Instructions
Conduct your own data analysis and create a presentation to share that documents your findings. You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it. Then you should use spreadsheets or another Excel-like software to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. This project is open-ended in that there is not one right answer.
## What do I need to install?
You may use any spreadsheet application you like. This includes Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, etc. Please note `.CSV` files may not save more than the active tab you are on at the time you close the file and it is recommended to use a spreadsheet tool like the two mentioned above for your work.

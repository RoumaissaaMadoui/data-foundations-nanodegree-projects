# Build Data Dashboards
## Project Instructions
In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal 
insights from **US Census Demographic data set** (data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it includes the census data for all counties in 2015). You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
